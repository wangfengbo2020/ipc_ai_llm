   I will use the EVB with wifi and ethnet directly, will not design hardware by myself.


2.2 Firmware 
   In this part, I will add a basic hm_sdk.h and an application. Use C/C++.

   | Applicaiton |
   -----------------------------------
   | hm_sdk.h    |
   -----------------------------------
   | System (boot,kernel,filesystem) |

2.3 Backend
   Based on Aliyun or AWS to provide an entire service for the app side and the product side.
   Python and C#

2.4 App
   The PC application should be supported at the beginning, then I will take the Android and iOS into consideration.

3. Schedule
   This project should be started at March 2025, rough to estimate, 9 months.
